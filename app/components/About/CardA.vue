    <SubSect title="About">
      <p>
        I am a front-end developer with a strong focus on user experience. I am
        passionate about building websites and applications that are easy to
        use and enjoyable to interact with.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been fascinated by computers ever since I could spell the word.
        I love to build and experiment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I watch movies, listen to music, and read blogs.

    <SubSect title="Experience">
      <p>
        Being self-taught has made me resourceful, eager to improve,
        and equipped me with a practical hands-on perspective
        on problem solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a freelance developer, I've collaborated with brands and individuals,
        including an immigration agency, to create innovative and user-friendly
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm primarily interested in full-time work, but I'm open to freelance
        opportunities that are a good fit for my skills and experience.
