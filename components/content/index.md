# Content Prose Components

A rip-off of [`@nuxt-themes/typography`](https://typography.nuxt.space/)

## Why?

- Fix light mode as default issue
  (only dark mode here)
  > The light, it burns!

- Use current unocss config and theme instead of pinceau's
  (single source of truth, only in theory, of course)
- Custom customization
