      <p>
        I am a front-end developer with a strong focus on user experience. I am
        passionate about creating websites and web applications that are easy to
        use and enjoyable to interact with.

      <p>
        I've been obsessed with technology ever since I could spell the word. I
        am self-taught and eager to improve myself and the quality of my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I watch movies, listen to music, and read blogs and
        interactive fiction.
