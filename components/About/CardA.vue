    <SubSect title="About">
      <p>
        I am a front-end developer with a strong focus on user experience. I am
        passionate about creating websites and web applications that are easy to
        use and enjoyable to interact with. I am self-taught and eager to
        improve myself and the quality of my work.

      <p>
        I've been obsessed with technology ever since I could spell the word.
        Learning what
        <code class="code">#ff2d2d</code> meant in 2018 was the sign from heaven
        I was waiting for, "DO COMPUTERS" it said.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I watch movies, read blogs and listen to music. I'm
        also a big fan of interactive fiction.
